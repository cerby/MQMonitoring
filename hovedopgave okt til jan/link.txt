[22:07]	shard	okay, im looking this over. what is it you were trying to do?
[22:08]	shard	also none of your stuff is thread-safe
[22:09]	shard	it looks like you're trying to do something in a background process and want it to check if its done every time the user refreshes the page?
[22:09]	Cerby	well, the thing i'm trying to do, is after the initial run in page_load, then i want it to only update one table at a time and it should only update the tables at the set intervals
[22:09]	Cerby	the user should never do anything, its for a monitoring program
[22:10]	Cerby	(except start the program)
[22:10]	Cerby	it basically looks up the queues in websphere, but it needs to read and update the queues at different intervals
[22:11]	Cerby	update the view of the queue*
[22:12]	shard	okay so,
[22:12]	shard	while you CAN do this
[22:12]	shard	its not a good idea
[22:12]	shard	http is really meant to be stateless. it gets stuff from the server, sends it off, and it's done
[22:12]	shard	you should be managing this from the frontend
[22:12]	shard	you can use an asp:updatepanel which lets you make calls without a postback
[22:13]	Cerby	i see
[22:13]	shard	then you put an asp:timer inside the update panel and have that run a method every interval
[22:13]	shard	which gets your data
[22:14]	Cerby	so i would need to send our update intervals into the view.asp
[22:14]	Cerby	I guess that can be done, just gotta get the xml info into it then
[22:15]	shard	is this webforms or mvc
[22:15]	Cerby	mvc
[22:16]	shard	okay, then never mind what i just said
[22:17]	shard	instead you should be doing everything in js
[22:17]	shard	with webapi
[22:17]	shard	so you have a get api that returns the data. your js has a timer, on interval it makes an ajax call, gets the data, puts it into the page
[22:18]	shard	here you go http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/3d39b4/rendering-a-partial-view-and-json-data-using-ajax-in-Asp-Net/
[22:18]	shard	your api returns a partialview so it's already rendered html and you just insert it into a div
[22:19]	Cerby	done down in sendtoview method
[22:19]	Refia	oh shard hanabi got on boardgamearena
[22:19]	shard	awesome
[22:19]	Refia	that game ruled
[22:20]	shard	so cerb, get rid of the threading stuff. make a method that returns a PartialView. call it with ajax
[22:21]	Cerby	i'll look into this
[22:21]	shard	the link i just posted above has everything you need
[22:22]	shard	theres a really simple bluffing game i want to make a site for. miiiight do that today
[22:22]	Cerby	i'll look into it in the morning, its past 10 here now
